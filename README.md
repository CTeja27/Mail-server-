<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Description

This email system is built on a foundation of trusted open-source software, meticulously configured to ensure privacy, security, and efficiency. Here's what powers the email service:

- **Postfix**: A fast and efficient mail transfer agent that ensures reliable delivery of emails while implementing stringent security measures.
  
- **Amavisd**: Acting as a bridge between Postfix and our security tools, Amavisd provides an additional layer of protection by filtering emails for spam and viruses before they reach your inbox.
  
- **Dovecot**: Our IMAP server of choice, Dovecot ensures lightning-fast access to your emails while maintaining utmost security and privacy standards.
  
- **IMAP**: The IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) protocol enables seamless synchronization of emails across devices, ensuring you stay connected wherever you go.
  
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful and reliable relational database management system, PostgreSQL stores and manages email-related data, ensuring data integrity and scalability.
  
- **SpamAssassin**: Equipped with advanced heuristics and pattern-matching algorithms, SpamAssassin intelligently filters out spam emails, keeping your inbox clean and clutter-free.
  
- **ClamAV**: Our trusted antivirus solution, ClamAV scans email attachments in real-time, safeguarding your inbox against malicious threats.
